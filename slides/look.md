## Look and Feel

note:
    Want:
    to be notified when something in the view changes

    to catch changes the break existing functionality/usability
    simple things such as hiding other elements are going to break the experience for the user
    prevent these simple mistakes and reduce the number of bugs

    cost benefit analysis

    DONT want:
    overhead of manual work
    constant of correcting broken tests

    one solution that we could achieve this is to take screenshost during different points of our app
